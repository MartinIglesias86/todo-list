I'm a full stack developer, with an aim on Solidity and web3 development.

I am interested in continuing to learn and work with:

âž¡ Solidity

âž¡ Express.js

âž¡ Node.js

Iâ€™m interested in learning and working on improving peopleâ€™s lives through blockchain technology. Iâ€™m constantly learning new things, and have a special affinity for new languages (both IT-related and spoken!).
